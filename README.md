The absolutely underrated meme build tool. This is a submodule of the [memealchemy](https://github.com/memealchemy/memealchemy) project, 
but this can be run separately for your own use.

## Usage

Clone the repo and install required packages:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/memealchemy/neem
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Neem comes with a powerful CLI to use the spiders as well as analyze and export output data.

Run `./neem crawl` or `scrapy crawl memes -o output.json` to run the spider. Either command should leave you with an output.json.
